redux - state management library  // other libs: router, weback, babel, axios, jest
    1. centralizes all application state in a single store (one object graph), can't store same data more than once
    2. container components are subscribed to redux store automatically, no event emitters, no dispatcher
    3. friendly to server side rendering 
    4. uses immutable store
    5. hot reloading - instantly see changes in browser without losing client side state
    6. time travel debugging, step forward/backward thru code and replay inter-actions
    7. small foot print
